You can find the slides from the class here, as well as recordings of my labs, challenges, and the grand prix. Recommended for people that don't wanna read code.
If you want to see the code, look at the links below!

# [Grandprix](https://github.com/MITLLRacecar/racecar-gp3-hot-rods)
The Grandprix is the final challenge among RACECAR students! It features a 9 section racecourse that must be completed autonomously. You'll find our final runthrough
of the course, which was high optimized. Our entire group pulled a all nighter to finish this!

# [Reinforcement Learning for Cone Slaloming Using ML-Agents in Unity](https://github.com/daniel-chuang/Racecar-ML)
We use ML-Agents in Unity to train a car to run through cone slaloming courses. Pretty cool stuff. You'll find a explaination video, along with recordings of the
model running through cone slaloming courses!

# [Labs](https://github.com/MITLLRacecar/racecar-daniel-chuang)
You will find my solutions to the class labs. Lab topics include automatic steering, a safety stop, a parking system, etc! Everything is done using three sensors:
color images, depth camera, and LIDAR.

# [Homework](https://github.com/daniel-chuang/beaverworks)
All of my homework assignments for the online course preluding the summer program.

# [Simulator](https://github.com/MITLLRacecar/Simulation)
This is the repo for the simulation, if you want to download it.
